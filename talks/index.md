Stressed out? Denial of service attacks from the providers’ perspective
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
by Alice Hutchings

The most frequent users of ‘booter’ or ‘stresser’ services are online gamers. These services are used to gain an advantage over an opponent by ‘booting’ them off the game with a denial of service attack. Booter services have customer-facing websites, whereby payments are taken for subscriptions, and attacks are requested. In order to understand this black market resource, we asked those providing the services to tell us about themselves and their activities. The operation of booter services requires not just technical expertise, but also information about the market for denial of service attacks, and how to monetise this. I will talk about how this knowledge is obtained, exposure to these services, and the escalation from using to operating booter services, and to other forms of cybercrime.

A Network of Sorrows: Small Adversaries and Small Allies
--------------------------------------------------------
by Quinn Norton

State actors dominate our news coverage, with hyperbolic talk of "cyberwar" and APT. But the vast majority of the costs of our terrible security are paid by normal people in day-to-day life. For most, the real adversaries are schools, families, random malware, ex-partners, maybe the occasional local law enforcement. While the big issues of governmental intrusion contribute to a toxic security culture, the blood and tears and lost money mostly come out of pedestrian, even often solved, security problems.

Small adversaries are infinite -- the internet will always make more ransomware, bad ex-boyfriends, and homophobic school administrations. But we aren't using the best tool we have in the fight against malware and cybercrime: the billions of users who, together, have tremendous power. Right now network life is filled with sorrow and fear. But by building up our small allies, bringing tools and knowledge to them, we can build a better network.

Quinn Norton, internet journalist and essayist, previously of Wired and The Message. I read too much history, use too much technology, obsess too much about security, know too much nerdy stuff, and am way too interested in the Mongolians.
Nothing Ever Ends is a fast romp though the history of computer and internet culture, from over two thousand years ago to several years in the future. I’ll tell the stories of some of key players in the history of the net, including the 19th century robber barons in America, Han dynasty feng shui practitioners, God, the RIAA, 90s software pirates, a little-know greek goddess, the Seattle Police Department. Over enough time, all the consequences become unintended. But all those unintended consequences give us the internet we have now, and the future we will have.

Exploiting and attacking seismological networks... remotely
-----------------------------------------------------------
by Bertin Bervis Bonilla and James Jara

In this presentation we are going to explain and demonstrate step by step in a real attack scenario how a remote attacker could elevate privileges in order to take control remotely in a production seismological network located at 183mts under the sea. We found several seismographs in production connected to the public internet providing graphs and data to anyone who connects to the embed web server running at port 80. The seismographs provide real time data based in the perturbations from earth and surroundings, we consider this as a critical infrastructure and is clear the lack of protection and implementation by the technicians in charge.

We are going to present 3 ways to exploit the seismograph which is segmented in 3 parts: Modem (GSM, Wi-Fi, Satellite, GPS,Com serial) {web server running at port 80 , ssh daemon} Sensor (Device collecting the data from ground or ocean bottom) Battery (1 year lifetime) Apollo server (MAIN acquisition core server) These vulnerabilities affect the Modem which is directly connected to the sensor , a remote connection to the modem it's all that you need to compromise the whole seismograph network. After got the root shell our goal is execute a post exploitation attack , This specific attack corrupts/modifies the whole seismological research data of a country/ area in real time. We are going to propose recommendations and best practices based on how to deploy a seismological network in order to avoid this nasty attacks.

Where should I host my malware?
-------------------------------
by Attila Marosi


The growth of IoT devices continues to raise questions about their role and impact in cybersecurity. Badly configured or poorly individual devices are often easy targets for malicious actors. Launching attacks at first seems more challenging due to the diversity of the ecosystem, but is actually doable and easy to execute. We explain how IoTs are a cybercriminal’s paradise:

In our SophosLabs research, we focused on a very generic attack scenario that will affect almost any device that has an FTP service. Your router or network-attached storage (NAS) are the most likely examples. These attacks typically exploit the level of trust people place on any content they see hosted on internal network shares. A successful attacker would abuse or compromise a default FTP account for guest access, place a “Trojan horse” on a visible file share and rely on human curiosity for the rest to happen. In many cases, root folders for FTP and WWW services are the same, making the attacker’s life even easier. Since many of the IoT devices publically expose FTP services world-wide, this fairly unsophisticated attack can result in a large number of infected “things” and provide great value to cybercriminals.

To assist our research, we developed an IoT scanning framework (“ScanR”) which is able to perform large scale network probes to assess the state of open FTP services and identify how many of them have been compromised . In our latest test, we utilized ScanR against 3 million open FTP servers determine the type of the device and the state of its security. The results were far worse than we expected.

Over 90% of the unprotected devices were found to be infected with at least one Malware threat or exhibiting the signs of an attack. In this talk, we’ll reveal the results of the research, exposing the number of vulnerable devices and the gigabytes of storage that is now freely available to attackers. We’ll also share the technical results of the malware analysis.

In summary, this talk will provide an insight into how the very old Internet protocols are being exploited on modern internet connected “things”, explain the risks it creates to home and corporate users and suggest recommendations on how businesses and users should be protecting themselves better against these unsophisticated, but dangerous and highly successful attack scenarios.

Interesting Malware - No, I'm not kidding...
--------------------------------------------
by Marion Marschalek

There is malware, and then, there is m.a.l.w.a.r.e. Last year we got our fingers on a set of exquisite binaries which were definitely not the usual kind. No I'd never call malware sophisticated, after all that's not what it takes to be dangerous; or interesting. But those were a challenging beast, unusually intriguing.

For the lack of a better name, and given all the whacky traits the binaries come with, we dubbed the family CheshireCat. That's the pink cat in Alice's wonderland with the most stupid grin. The CheshireCat binaries have been around since 2002, some are built for workstations as old as Windows NT4, they support dial-up connections and executable header checks for the NewExecutable file format. Go figure. We came to the conclusion, someone very dedicated has built CheshireCat for very special networks and kept his operation under the radar for more than a decade.

This talk will introduce CheshireCat's implementation traits, stealth tactics and wonderous functionalities. Special attention will be paid to the retro coding style and the kind of functional obfuscation that make CheshireCat so special.

House intercoms attacks: when frontdoors become backdoors
---------------------------------------------------------
by Sébastien Dudek

To break into a building, several methods have already been discussed, such as trying to find the code paths of a digicode, clone RFID cards, use some social engineering attacks, or the use of archaic methods like lockpicking a door lock or breaking a window.

New methods are now possible with recent intercoms. Indeed, these intercoms are used to call the tenants to access the building. But little study has been performed on how these boxes communicate to request and grant access to the building.

In the past, they were connected with wires directly to apartments. Now, these are more practical and allow residents to open doors not only from their classic door phone, but to forward calls to their home or mobile phone. Private houses are now equipped with these new devices and its common to find these "connected" intercoms on recent and renovated buildings.

In this presentation we will introduce the Intercoms and focus on one particular devices that is commonly installed in buildings today. Then we will present our analysis on an interesting attack vector, which already has its own history. After this analysis, we will present our environment to test the intercoms, and show some practical attacks and our results that could be performed on these devices. During this talks, the evolution of our mobile lab and some advances on the 3G intercoms attacks will be also presented.

KillTheHashes 30 million Malware DNA profiling exercise
-------------------------------------------------------
by Luciano Martins, Rodrigo Cetera and Javier Bassi


Similar to human fingerprints, every malware has its own unique digital fingerprint that differentiates it from others.  As a result, malware will always attempt to hide its true self by deleting or changing this information to avoid detection by antivirus companies and malware researchers.

Doing malware profiling allows malware hunters and analysts to really interrogate the internals of malware and perform searches over a large number of file characteristics. For instance, instead of relying on file-level hashes, we can compute other features such as imported functions, strings, constants, file segments, code regions, or anything that is defined in the file type specification, we had built a software to perform those tasks CodexGigas that provides us with more than 142 possible searchable patterns, that can be combined.

Since malware developers go to great lengths to obfuscate their characteristics, it is often difficult for by researchers and malware analysts to identify multiple characteristics and correlation points.

By analyzing malware internals, the algorithm is able to build characteristic families to which a new sample can be categorized and therefore identified for specific behavior, enabling early detection of new malware by comparing against existing malware.

We will demonstrate the results of our work and the techniques and tool used to derive these results.

Unveiling the attack chain of Russian-speaking cybercriminals
-------------------------------------------------------------
by Wayne Huang and Sun Huang

Existing research on the Asprox actor has focused primarily on the malware they spread, but little has been published on who they are, how they operate and spread malware, and what resources they own. In this rare talk, we will disclose our many years of deep research on this actor: for example, since their initial operation in 2007, the Asprox gang now owns 2+ billion compromised emails, 2+ million compromised web servers (backdoored with webshells), 0.9+ million compromised SMTP accounts (some of which belong to the US military), 0.4+ million compromised FTP accounts, and SSH access to 1200+ compromised servers.
We will detail how they’ve evolved into their currently sophisticated infection infrastructure, including their multiple layers of distribution and command-and-control servers, their anti-detection proxy servers, their malware obfuscation tool chain, their means of infecting endpoints, their large scale tool to auto-compromise websites and inject webshells, and their evolution in 2014 to Android malware and mobile botnets.
We will study statistics such as daily downloads and conversion rate, and will explain their monetization methods within multiple underground economies, and the economics. Finally, we’ll cover how we’ve managed to collect our data, how we analyzed the data, and the many techniques we used in tracking this actor.

Cyber Grand Shellphish: Shellphish and the DARPA Cyber Grand Challenge
----------------------------------------------------------------------
by Kevin Borgolte

Autonomous hacking is becoming a reality. Over the last years, DARPA organized the Cyber Grand Challenge (CGC), a security competition in which participants had to develop a system able to automatically exploit and patch binaries without any manual interaction.

We qualified for the final event and fielded our Cyber Reasoning System, the Mechanical Phish, against six other competitors. Our system placed third overall, was the first self-funded team, and the first academic-only team.

In this talk, we introduce Mechanical Phish. We present the challenges we faced and tackled, and the solutions we implemented for them while developing one of the first fully-autonomous hacking systems, which spans over 100,000 lines of code (mostly in Python).

We have open-sourced Mechanical Phish and we demonstrate how it can be used to automatically find bugs, create exploits, and patch vulnerable binaries.

Specifically, Mechanical Phish uses a combination of symbolic execution (powered by angr, the binary analysis platform developed at UC Santa Barbara) and fuzzing to find bugs. From exploitable bugs, it automatically generates proofs of vulnerability to show code execution capabilities. In addition, our system patches existing binaries to make them resilient against known and unknown attacks with negligible performance impact. Finally, given the hardware-setup and the no-human-intervention policy of the Cyber Grand Challenge final event, we will touch on how we designed Mechanical Phish to be extremely realiable, efficient in resource usage, and a fault-tolerant distributed system.

Spy Hard with a Vengeance: How one city stood up to the Department of Homeland Security
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
by aestetix and Brian Hofer

This talk will cover the reign of surveillance that has secretly taken over the United States at the local level through use of Federal grant money, and offer suggestions on how we can fight back. It’s the story of how the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) tried to create a fusion center in Oakland, California. In particular, we'll be sharing details of the Oakland privacy policy we helped create in response to this intrusive spy system, and the advocacy that led to its creation. Our hope is to teach the framework we created, shed light on how these issues affect both Americans and Europeans, and how businesses and governments can find a balance between security and privacy.

The Metabrik Platform: Rapid Development of Reusable Security Tools
-------------------------------------------------------------------
by Patrice Auffret

During the course of a penetration test, a malware analysis, a forensic analysis or a Capture The Flag contest, who has never been in the situation of having to develop
The Metabrik Platform [1] goal is to normalize how we use tools and how they interoperate together by providing a Platform as a UNIX shell, merged with a Perl REPL interpreter and a virtually infinite number of Briks: small reusable components that just do one task. Learning it is as simple as knowing the five Commands.

You glue Briks together through the Shell. Idea is to have a set of common bricks having their own purpose and connect them to create a new tool or Brik. The more you write Briks, the more complex tasks you will be able to achieve. Many Briks were written from already existing ones and Metabrik itself is written using Briks. In the end, Metabrik is a development platform which brings normalization and weaponization for everyday tools, being new or existing ones.

We will cover forensic::scalpel Brik as an example of improving existing tools by glueing with new Briks. We will then show how we solved a root-me challenge by using just a few Briks. As another example, we will show VM instrumentation for extracting IOCs from malwares. More examples are available on the Web site [1] and newest ones will be presented during the conference thanks to the now more than 200 Briks.

Bridging political gaps with code
---------------------------------
by Okhin


One of the main mission of La Qaudrature du Net, as a NGO fighting for human right sin the digital spheres, is to develop engagement of people to pressure political bodies such as national or european parliaments.

To achieve this goal, LQDN has developped over the year a toolbox to help document the political process, to help keeping tabs on representatives through their all career, and to mobilize citizens to take actions and to reestablish dialog with these representatives.

I will discuss how this process has been going into LQDN actions and how the dynamics between code, developers and users (both internal and external) are at the core of this process.

From paying technical debt, to volunteer management, from ideological to technical points of view, let's talk about how code can be political.

WiFi Exploitation: How passive interception leads to active exploitation
------------------------------------------------------------------------
by Solomon Sonya

When was the last time you thought to yourself, hmm, I wonder if an attacker is exploiting my smart phone and laptop as a result of merely leaving my WiFi enabled? Or, when did you think: I wonder if a person can create a profile about me and possibly determine where I live, work, and places I have been simply via passive interception of the 802.11x frames beaconed from my devices? Ok, let's go a bit further: when was the last time you realized your smart phone is wirelessly leaking details regarding every network you have stored on your device for everyone to see and when did you ever consider that an attacker could intercept your beacons, establish a rogue AP mimicking exactly what you are looking for, and MiTM your system directly back to the attacker automatically? Do you even know the information your smart phone is constantly broadcasting out via that wireless NIC of yours?

Welp, if any of these questions take you by surprise, then this talk may be of particular interest to you. I show you exactly how to engineer a distributed sensor network that captures, parses, interprets, and visualizes 802.11x frames/messages in order to build the picture of devices communicating within the sensor mesh. Next, I show how to build the connector agents to resolve GPS location of devices in the area and extracted from your device's broadcasted frames. After this, I'll show you how we interface with Google Map to interactively display the location profiles we create on users intercepted within the area. Finally, we go into carrying out MiTM attacks based on what your devices is requesting to automatically exploit the user without their knowledge. We conclude with enhancements required to better secure your devices from future exploitation.

This talk wouldn't be complete without a brand new tool release! Developing a framework like this is not as difficult or costly as you might think. I'll show you exactly how to do it. And if the coding and parsing of raw 802.11 frames is not your cup of tea, no worries at all. This talk talk releases and demo's a new framework I've built called Theia Sensor Suite that automatically analyzes all of this data and visualizes it for you in a robust GUI and framework. 802.11 exploitation will never go away, so let’s get started!

2016: The Infosec Crossroads
----------------------------
by Saumil Shah

"Today's attacks succeed because the defense is reactive". I have been researching attacks and offensive techniques since the past 16 years. As the defenses kept catching up and closing open doors, we attackers looked for new avenues and vectors. This talk looks back on the state of defenses during my days of One-Way Web Hacking in 2001 to Stegosploit in 2016, and a common pattern emerges. Defense boils down to reacting to new attacks and then playing catch-up. It is time to take another look at defense strategy. In this talk I present the basics of what should be the next evolution of pro-active defense architecture.

Exploit generation and JavaScript analysis automation with WinDBG
-----------------------------------------------------------------
by Fitzl Csaba and Miklos Desbordes-Korcsev

Our presentation will cover two different topics, which will show how easy and powerful is to automate various tasks with WinDBG.

1.  Exploit generation Many people are familiar with scripts which can help during an exploit development. But what if we automate the entire process once we have the bug? In the presentation we will show a tool that can take a POC BoF exploit (which generates a crash / EIP overwrite) and from that it can automatically generate a fully working exploit.

2. JavaScript analysis automation Javascript code deobfuscation always presents a challenge for malware analysts, analysis being time consuming, sometime even anti-debugging techniques make it more difficult. What if we had a mechanism to see into the very core of the JavaScript engine and the DOM and be able to track down what the malware was up do without having to make any changes to the code and without giving the malware a chance to sense a debugger being present? Eval? Document.write? Lambdas? No problem!

badGPO - Using GPOs for Persistence and Lateral Movement
--------------------------------------------------------
by Yves Kraft and Immanuel Willi

Group Policy is a feature which provides centralized management and configuration functions for the Microsoft operating system, application and user settings. Group Policy is simply the easiest way to reach out and configure computer and user settings on networks based on Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS). Such policies are widely used in enterprise environments to control settings of clients and servers: registry settings, security options, scripts, folders, and software installation and maintenance, just to name a few. Settings are contained in so-called Group Policy Objects (GPOs) and can be misused in a sneaky way to distribute malware and gain persistence in an automated manner in a post exploitation scenario of an already compromised domain. In a proof of concept, inspired by Phineas Fishers' article about pwning HackingTeam, we will show how persistence and lateral movement in a compromised company network can be achieved, and demonstrate some PowershellEmpire Framework modules which we created. PowershellEmpire is basically a post-exploitation framework that utilises the widely-deployed PowerShell tool for all your system-smashing needs. There are already functionalities built-in regarding GPOs. We tried to further evolve the miss-use of GPOs in additional scenarios. Furthermore, we will discuss some countermeasures including detection and prevention mechanisms

Machine Duping: Pwning Deep Learning Systems
--------------------------------------------
by Clarence Chio

Deep learning and neural networks have gained incredible popularity in recent years, but most deep learning systems are not designed with security and resiliency in mind, and can be duped by any attacker with a good understanding of the system. In this talk, we will dive into popular deep learning software and show how it can be tampered with to do what you want it do, while avoiding detection by system administrators. Besides giving a high level overview of deep learning and its inherent shortcomings in an adversarial setting, we will focus on tampering real systems to show real weaknesses in critical systems built with it. In particular, this demo­driven session will be focused on manipulating an image recognition, speech recognition, and phishing detection system built with deep learning at the core.

Credential Assessment: Mapping Privilege Escalation at Scale
------------------------------------------------------------
by Matt Weeks

In countless intrusions from large retail giants to oil companies, attackers have progressed from initial access to complete network compromise. In the aftermath, much ink is spilt and products are sold on how the attackers first obtained access and how the malware they used could or could not have been detected, while little attention is given to the credentials they found that turned their access on a single-system into thousands more. This process, while critical for offensive operations, is often complex, involving many links in the escalation chain composed of obtaining credentials on system A that grant access to system B and credentials later used on system B that grant further access, etc. We’ll show how to identify and combat such credential exposure at scale with the framework we developed. We comprehensively identify exposed credentials and automatically construct the compromise chains to identify maximal access and privileges gained, useful for either offensive or defensive purposes.

BtleJuice: the Bluetooth Smart Man In The Middle Framework
----------------------------------------------------------
by Damien Cauquil


A lot of Bluetooth Low Energy capable devices are spread since the last few years, offering a brand new way to compromise many "smart" objects: fitness wristbands, smart locks and padlocks and even healthcare devices. But this protocol poses some new challenges: how may one easily intercept every communication between a device and an application ? How to easily spoof the behavior of a device to assess authentication ?

During months (years ?) we've been using Bluetooth Low Energy sniffers (like Ubertooth or even Adafruit's Bluefruit sniffer) to perform security assessments on many connected devices, with not so much success because of the erratic way BLE sniffers work. There were no easy way to perform a decent man-in-the-middle attack on BLE enabled devices. This is why we developed 'BtleJuice', a framework to fill in the gap and allow spying on communications between two BLE devices without SDR. We designed it to be modular and to allow MAC spoofing using a compatible Bluetooth LE adapter as data is relayed through network, that means both devices (the cloned and the real one) may be at different locations (or isolated) thus avoiding interference.

The ability to intercept every bit of data between two BLE enabled devices is an efficient way to passively determine a device's behavior and its attack surface and of course to find vulnerabilities. Reverse-engineering mobile applications is no more mandatory to retrieve samples of data to perform fuzzing or even understand how the device and its related components work. Furthermore, the ability to perform on-the-fly data modification gives an opportunity to create improved fuzzers and to detect more vulnerabilities.

We will demonstrate the efficiency of this framework on real devices, intercepting every piece of information and patching data on-the-fly, but also the impact in term of security.

When Crypto Fails
-----------------
by Yaniv Balmas, Ben Herzog

"There is a theory which states that if ever anyone discovers exactly how to properly use cryptography, it will instantly disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarre and inexplicable.
There is another theory which states that this has already happened."

Cryptography is no longer a niche malware feature. It has become the weapon of choice to subject victims to extortion, preform covert communications, achieve stealth and much more.
Almost no crimeware bag of tricks is complete without a nasty ransomware binary somewhere in it.

Like any other dangerous weapon, cryptography should be handled with care; in the wrong hands, it can easily become a double-edged sword - and, in fact, it does. There appears to be no upper bound for how ill-designed cryptography can be. Whenever you think you have seen the worst of it... Well, you better think again.

Our talk will showcase several real-world cryptographic disasters encountered by our researchers. Some are more well-known than others, but all have had consequences - for the attacker as well as their victims.

Trying to extract value from these failures is often a crapshoot. In some cases, there is not much to do but to watch cryptography fail and laugh\cry. However, in other cases - especially if you know what to look for - you may be able to use cryptographic failures to your advantage and subvert the original intent of the malware to your benefit.

This presentation will try to educate the audience on the common methods that can be employed to identify those failures, and perhaps save yourself or others from a very sticky situation.
Once our presentation is over we will also release a tool we designed that can be used for triage of encrypted files, aimed to help you do just that.

When Practice Informs Technology
--------------------------------
by Mahsa Alimardani

Digital rights activists and social change actors often operate in singular movements that seldom overlap, creating a disconnect between technology and practical needs. Non governmental organizations (NGOs) with insufficient knowledge of technology, or technological infrastructure may try to fill this void by allocating funding to attain the most up to date technologies or best practices, which may not be of relevance to local needs and contexts, ultimately proving ineffective. The latest technologies, best tech practices or rapid response expertise are often not only ineffective, but find themselves repeated within the same networks rather than expanding beyond immediate existing trust relationships between at risk Internet users and technologists. There is a need to bridge the relationship between the practices of change actors and the decisions of technologists to ensure that they inform the technologies and digital security guidelines given to them -not the other way. Deliberate efforts to connect technologist with civil society actors beyond their existing networks and foster new trust networks are therefore necessary. Emphasis will be given to three areas of focus: inclusion of marginalized groups such as women, youth and LGBT; privacy vs. publicity concerns; and UX/usability concerns to facilitate the building of networks, bring women and those marginalized into the technology discourse through an environment that fosters trust, and exchange tools, technologies and best practices.

Of Mice and Keyboards: On the Security of Modern Wireless Desktop Sets
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Wireless desktop sets consisting of a wireless mouse, a wireless keyboard, and a USB dongle have become more popular and more widespread in the last couple of years. Seen as potential target, those radio-based devices are of more interest to people with malicious intentions than their wired counterparts, due to the fact that they can also be attacked remotely from a safe distance via radio signals.

As wireless desktop sets represent an attractive target both allowing to take control of a computer system and to gain knowledge of sensitive data like passwords, they have been frequently analyzed for security vulnerabilities and were successfully attacked in the past.

SySS GmbH started a research project about the security of modern wireless desktop sets using AES encryption in 2015, as there was no publicly available data concerning security issues in current wireless mice and keyboards. Up to now, several security vulnerabilities in modern wireless desktop sets of different manufacturers like Microsoft, Cherry, Logitech, Fujitsu and Perixx have been found and reported in the course of our responsible disclosure program.

In our talk, we will present the results of this research and will demonstrate ways in which modern wireless desktop sets of several manufacturers can be attacked by practically exploiting different security vulnerabilities.

Hadoop safari : Hunting for vulnerabilities
-------------------------------------------
by Mahdi BRAIK and Thomas DEBIZE

With the growth of data traffic and data volumetric analysis needs, “Big Data” has become one of the most popular fields in IT and many companies are currently working on this topic, by deploying Hadoop clusters, which is the current most popular Big Data framework. As every new domain in computer science, Hadoop comes (by default) with truely no security. During the past year we dug into Hadoop and tried to understand Hadoop infrastructure and security.

This talks aims to present in a simple way Hadoop security issues or rather its “concepts”, as well as to show the multiples vectors to attack a cluster. By vectors we mean practical vectors or to sum it up: how can you access the holy “datalake” after plugging your laptop onto the target network.

Moreover, you will learn how Hadoop (in)security model was designed explaining the different security mechanisms implemented in core Hadoop services. You will also discover tools, techniques and procedures we created and consolidated to make your way to the so called “new black gold”: data. Through different examples, you will be enlightened on how these tools and methods can be easily used to get access to data, but also to get a remote system access on cluster members.

Eventually and as Hadoop is the gathering of several services and projects, you will apprehend that patch management in this field is often complicated and known vulnerabilities often stay actionnable for a while.

Malware Triage IOCs - Using Open Data to Help Develop Robust Indicators
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
by Sergei Frankoff and Sean Wilson

Whether you are in the enterprise using malware triage as a gate to your incident response process, or a researcher using triage as a way to identify interesting malware samples, Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) will serve as the feedback loop in your triage process.

As a malware sample makes its way through your triage process the output should be an IOC. Not only will the IOC be used as part of your malware hunting process but it can also be used in future triage to avoid re-analyzing similar samples. The key to an efficient triage process is robust IOCs, the more robust your IOC the more variations of malware it will cover and the less time you will have to spend on re-analyzing similar samples.

We present an iterative approach to building robust malware indicators; first developing primary indicators, then mining open data for related malware samples, using the collection of similar samples to build robust IOCs, and finally testing the IOCs for effectiveness. We will cover multiple free tools that can assist with the use of primary indicators as pivots to mine open data repositories, as well as test the effectiveness of your IOCs. During the presentation we will use real malware samples with demonstrations to walk through each step in the process.

This is not a workshop about IOC formats, it is about the process used to build an IOC. We briefly cover the basics for Yara and OpenIOC but any format can be used with the process we teach.

Key takeaways include;

- familiarization with the use of IOCs in the malware triage process
- a standardized process for developing robust IOCs
- exposure to a quiver of free tools useful for indicator pivot searching
- how to test IOC effectiveness with unknown samples

Equipment you need;

- You must have a computer (preferably a VM) that you are comfortable analyzing malware with, if it is a work computer please check with your IT staff.
- You must have Administrator/Root privileges and the ability to install software on your computer.
- You must have the ability to disable any anti-virus software on your computer.

This workshop is aimed at incident responders and malware analysts who have a basic understanding of malware and the malware triage process. However this is not an advanced course and deep knowledge of reverse engineering and malware analysis is NOT required.

Introduction to Security Onion
------------------------------
by David Szili

Security Onion is a Linux distribution based on Ubuntu, designed for security analysts. It contains many security tools such as Snort, Suricata, Bro, OSSEC, Sguil, Squert, ELSA, NetworkMiner, etc. to create a platform for network security monitoring. The unique combination of features and concepts like pivoting from one tool to another one, having different network security monitoring data types (like full packet capture) and the capability to form a distributed sensor architecture make Security Onion one of the most powerful solutions which often outperforms many of the commercial products.

The goal of this introductory workshop is to familiarize the participants with Security Onion, guide them through the first steps of setting it up and start analyzing traffic. The first part of the workshop will be about installing and configuring Security Onion in a Virtual Machine. The next section will be a quick walk-through to the primary interfaces (Squert, Sguil, ELSA), the different NSM data types and pivoting between interfaces and data types. At the end of the workshop, we will take a look at a few exercises and real life case studies, replay traffic and perform analysis using the tools and data types available in Security Onion.

Requirements for the workshop:

- A laptop with at least 8 GB of RAM and more than 20 GB of free disk space (VT-x support must be enabled on the host system).
- Application to run Virtual Images (type-2 hypervisor), such as VMWare Workstation (recommended), VMWare Player, VirtualBox or similar software.

Advanced Exploitation: ROP and protections bypass under Linux
-------------------------------------------------------------
by Julien Bachmann

This workshop’s goal is to give trainees an understanding of the exploitation technique known as Return Oriented Programming, or ROP, through both explanations and gradually complex exercises. The labs will be performed on Linux and binaries will be 32 bits.
After a brief recap on buffer overflows the workshop goes on to explain protection built-into the compiler and the OS (canaries, NX, ...). Introduction to ROP is done by starting with ret2libc exploitation which is a specialization of the ROP technique.
ROP concepts such as gadgets, ROP chains, primitives are detailed. Tools such as ropgadget and rp++ are presented and a detailed ROP chain is then studied.
The workshop then continues with a live example before entering the lab part. Example of lab manual (this one was given in a university) can be found in annex but subject to change in order to match timeframe.

HIDden secrets in Soft Token: A security study of HID Global Soft Token
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
by Mouad Abouhali (@_m00dy_)

Nowadays, many companies tend to deploy two factors authentication means to remotely access their infrastructure. Lately, the use of Soft Token applications instead of Hardware tokens seduces more and more, especially in regards to financial aspects (deployment and maintenance costs). In This current talk I will present a security study of the Android version of HID Soft Token application (HID Global). This study covers the mechanisms that are used by the application to protect the main functional processing as generating encryptions keys, OTP keys, etc. Besides, the study lays the groundwork for shedding light on two vulnerabilities that affect the application.

Indeed, the cryptographic operations that are implemented by the application suffer from a certain weaknesses that allow an attacker (under certain circumstances) to retrieve the main resources of an enrolled HID Soft Token application that belongs to a legitimate user, clone its configuration and particularly discover the victim’s PIN by the means of a brute force attack.

The Fantastic 4 ... forensic domains: net, disk, mem, mal
---------------------------------------------------------
by David Durvaux, Christophe Vandeplas

Forensic analysis (network, disk, memory, malware) is one of the core tasks of the incident handling activity. Where many analysts stop the investigation once they have identified the malware sample and write a report saying 'the attacker had full control...'; for us the fun only starts and we go further to find the juicy stuff that really matters.

With our favorite open source tools (plaso, volatility, rekall, cuckoo, …) we will perform network, disk, memory and malware analysis of the forensic evidence (Windows 10) created for the Locked Shields Cyber Exercise by the CCDCOE. The goal is to introduce you to some nice features of our modern toolset, while also taking a moment of silence in respect of old deprecated tools like log2timeline.pl that are still actively used today.

Even more importantly we will not look into those 4 domains (network, disk, memory, malware) separately, as is done way too often, but will show you the immense value of putting all this information together allowing us to find the really juicy traces that were left on the system and would never be found.  

We welcome the following audiences:

1. An analyst looking to get more out of his evidence, with less time spent, allowing him to report business-impacting things.
2. Curious people that want to get ideas, tools and pointers in order to learn on very well built forensic evidence.

The workshop takes only two hours, so we do not have the time to do a full forensic analysis from scratch. This workshop will be a walkthrough of successes and failures of the analysis. While we will distribute some limited evidence we HIGHLY recommend you to download ALL the evidence beforehand.
Also those that like a challenge can start working on the evidence and send us a report beforehand. We will tell you if you are missing stuff, but will not give any hints or answers until the workshop.  (aka: try harder)

Malware analysis made easy with Volatility plugins
--------------------------------------------------
by Thomas Chopitea

Volatility is a very well known, used, and loved memory forensics framework in the DFIR community. It's usage has been largely documented and illustrated with different use-cases. But one aspect of Volatility that may remain a bit obscure to analysts with even solid experience with memory forensics is the creation of Volatility plugins to automate specific tasks.

This workshop is meant to make malware and DFIR analysts familiar with Volatility’s plugin framework. The goal is to cover Volatility and live-memory analysis basics and have every attendee leaving with an operational understanding of the different plugin strategies and implementations. To illustrate the plugin creation process, the workshop will be articulated around the analysis of an instance of the Locky ransomware.

Bio: Guillaume Arcas
--------------------

Guillaume Arcas has been working in security since 1995 initially as a Security and Network Analyst, primarily in the Internet and Banking industries. He has been member of the Honeynet Project’s French Chapter since 2010. He currently works for Sekoia CERT as an expert (according to the definition of "expert" by Harlan Carvey in his preface to his "Windows Forensic Analysis Toolkit 3d Edition"'s book) specializing in Digital Forensics and Incident Response. When not hunting for endangered species hanging on the Internet, Guillaume enjoys reading (thrillers, science fiction, history, and philosophy – in no particular order as long as it is printed) and walking his dog. He also nourishes a certain nostalgia for the esheep.exe software – hence his Twitter avatar (@y0m).
